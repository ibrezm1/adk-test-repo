Requirements
You need either a MacOS, Windows 11 or Ubuntu Computer
Basic knowledge of Python, Powershell/Terminal, VS code is a must - we will use the Python SDK for ADK
Basic familiarity with LLMs like Google Gemini and your choice of OS is a must
Description
TL;DR - Learn to build AI agents using Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) on Mac + Windows + Ubuntu. This course introduces you to this new agent framework, walks you through Google’s ADK, and shows you how to build, debug, and deploy intelligent agents using Python ADK (v1.0.0). You'll get hands-on experience with real code, multi-agent systems, streaming, and tool calling.



Note - Course in beta, lectures being added frequently every 1-2 weeks.



What You Will Build

Multiple AI agents using Google ADK (Python ADK v1.0.0)

ADK’s Web Playground and step-by-step tracing

Voice and video communication with agents (ADK’s built-in capability)

Basic MCP and A2A integration/compatibility



Key Features of Google ADK

Software-first Agent Design: Develop agents like apps, with predictable behavior and structure

Web Playground: Use adk web to launch a full visual UI to interact with your agents

Event & Token Streaming: Real-time tracing, token-by-token output, and request inspection

Bi-directional Audio/Video: Let agents hear, speak, and see users in real-time

Model Agnostic: Use Gemini, OpenAI, or even open-source models



Important Notes

The Course is recorded on a MacBook and Windows and Ubuntu

Lectures are labeled with OS it is recorded on. When no label is provided, it means that it is a common lecture for all platforms

Course is in Beta with lectures being added every 1-2 weeks. Course outline and plan is tentaive!

This course is based on Google ADK which is still evolving. The Python version (v1.0.0) offers stability and used for most implementations. Things might break, please be open to that. We'll address these aspects as they happen!
